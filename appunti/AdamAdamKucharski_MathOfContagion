reproduction number R ~ 2.2
serial interval     T ~ 5 days

(D) duration of the infection (around a week)
(O) opportunities during the infection (social behaviour) ~ 5 people per day

(T) transmission probability
(S) susceptibility of the target

R = D x O x T x S

Isolation of the infected (quarantine) --> D
Social distancing --> 0
Masks and other PPE (DPI) --> T
Vaccine? Good health/immune system --> S

Reproduction number can (does) change over time


Transmission chains of COVID19 (like viral tweets) come from specific events with many links more than long chains of the average reproduction rate (like Ice. Most tweets don't go anywhere.
Sparks lead to super spreading, mass audience, mass amplification.

Suggestions that 80% of transmission originates from 20% of the infections. 

Dynamic: small initially expansion, explosive take off (transition)

SIR model
SEIR model

Intensive Care Unit for 1 in 20 (5%) infected
ICU bed for 1 in 3400 people in USA (0.6 %)

Infection Fatality Rate IFR ~ 0.5 % (1%) 
while seasonal flu's IFR is aroud 0.1%

44% of all transmissions are pre-symptomatic!
