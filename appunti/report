Evolution of a pandemic in a small world network

Watts stroglatz small world networks (rewired lattices with p probability)
Params: p (probability of rewiring lattice edges into random links) 
        k (level of clustering in terms of lattice connected neighbours)  
        n (dimension of the network)

Presentation of the typical characteristics of the small world graphs: recreate the plot with C (clustering) and L (min path distance) for a pool of differen graphs in function of p (test also k)

One peculiarity: fast spreading of diseases (contagion), iportance of the rewired edges in sensibly lowering the distance between clusters

Similarity with real cases:  high p and high k --> worst case?
                             high p and low k  --> globalized but non village-like society or restrictions to aggregation
                             low p and high k  --> international lockdown, return to small communities
                             low p and low k   --> full lockdown
                             low p and low k + synthomatic nodes are disconnected --> lockdown + quarantine

Epidemic model:

SEIR over a network, with R(DOTS) parameters
    
    (D) duration of the infection (around a week)
    (O) opportunities during the infection (social behaviour) ~ 5 people per day

    (T) transmission probability
    (S) susceptibility of the target

    R = D x O x T x S

    Isolation of the infected (quarantine) --> D
    Social distancing --> 0
    Masks and other PPE (DPI) --> T
    Vaccine? Good health/immune system --> S

    Reproduction number can (does) change over time

In order to represent any network, it is necessary to characterize the properties of the corresponding graph of nodes and links. Studies on the collaboration network of movie actors have been described in literature such as the work done by (Watts and Strogatz, 1998), and Barabási and Albert in (1999) and (2000). The general characteristics are described below.[5][6][7][8][9]

    According to Watts and Strogatz (1998), the movie/actor network indicated the following characteristics showing a small-world property of the underlying network:

    Size: 225 226
    Average degree: 61
    Average path length: 3.65
    Clustering coefficient: 0.79

Compared to a random graph of the same size and average degree, the average path length is close in value. However, the clustering coefficient is much higher for the movie actor network.

    The network characteristics and scaling exponents given by Barabási and Albert (1999), indicates the scale-free behavior:

    Size: 212 250
    Average degree: 28.78
    Cutoff for power-law scaling: 900
    Clustering coefficient: 0.79

Therefore, the underlying network has the scale-free degree distribution p(k) ~ k−γactor, with an exponent γactor = 2.3 ± 0.1 (Barabási and Albert, 1999), (Albert and Barabási, 2000).

    According to (Newman, Strogatz, and Watts, 2001), the movie actor network can be described by a bipartite graph. Nodes in this graph are of two types: movies and actors. And the edges only connect nodes of different types. So edges link the co-stars to the movie they appear in. Therefore, the collaboration graph of film actors can be constructed using a transformation matrix of the bipartite graph interaction matrix.

reproductive number

    In a fully susceptible population, the basic reproductive number R0 is the number of secondary infections generated by the first infectious individual over the course of the infectious period. R0=S*L* β (where S = the number of susceptible hosts, L = length of infection, and β = transmissibility). When R0> 1, disease will spread. It is essentially a measure of the expected or average outcome of transmission. The effective reproductive number takes into account non-susceptible individuals. This is the threshold parameter used to determine whether or not an epidemic will occur, and determines:

     *   The initial rate of increase of an epidemic (the exponential growth phase).

     *   The final size of an epidemic (what fraction of susceptibles will be infected).

     *   The endemic equilibrium fraction of susceptibles in a population (1/ R0).

     *   The critical vaccination threshold, which is equal to 1-(1/ R0), and determines the number of people that must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of a pathogen.

    
Ro for SEIR model on a complex network
Since the latency delays the start of the individual’s infectious period, the secondary spread from an infected individual will occur at a later time compared with an SIR model, which has no latency. Therefore, including a longer latency period will result in slower initial growth of the outbreak. However, since the model does not include mortality, the basic reproductive number, R0 = β/γ , does not change.

(by Wiki)
Methods used to calculate R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} R_{0} include the survival function, rearranging the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix, the next-generation method,[44] calculations from the intrinsic growth rate,[45] existence of the endemic equilibrium, the number of susceptibles at the endemic equilibrium, the average age of infection[46] and the final size equation. Few of these methods agree with one another, even when starting with the same system of differential equations.[39] Even fewer actually calculate the average number of secondary infections. Since R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} R_{0} is rarely observed in the field and is usually calculated via a mathematical model, this severely limits its usefulness.[47]
