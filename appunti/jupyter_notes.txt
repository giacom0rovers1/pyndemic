# This is a level 1 heading

## This is a level 2 heading

This is some plain text that forms a paragraph. Add emphasis via **bold** and __bold__, or *italic* and _italic_. 

Paragraphs must be separated by an empty line. 

* Sometimes we want to include lists. 
* Which can be bulleted using asterisks. 

1. Lists can also be numbered. 
2. If we want an ordered list.

[It is possible to include hyperlinks](https://www.example.com)

Inline code uses single backticks: `foo()`, and code blocks use triple backticks: 
```
bar()
``` 
Or can be indented by 4 spaces: 

    foo()
    
And finally, adding images is easy: ![Alt text](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)
