	\section*{Introduction}
	\label{sec:intro}
	This work studies and compares a series of idealized contagion scenarios, simulated over different un-weighted un-directed static random networks resembling human-to-human interactions. It is inspired by the current worldwide effort in containing the COVID-19 pandemic and follows mainly \citet{Pastor-Satorras} and \citep{Firth2020}.
	
 	In the first section I will present the fundamental differential equations and the deterministic numerical solutions of the SIR and SEIR models. I will then compare the deterministic predictions with the results of discrete-time simulations over various random networks. The networks share the same size and average connectivity, but differ in clustering and degree distribution, allowing a to move progressively from simple models to more realistic and complex ones, to show different aspects of the contagion dynamics. The simulations are carried out in Python 3, exploiting the \textit{NetworkX} and \textit{NDlib} libraries, which are integrated in a specific framework crafted for the occasion \citep{pyndemic}. Finally, I will discuss some mitigation and immunization strategies.

  \subsection{The SIR epidemic model}
  The SIR model divides the population into three compartments: susceptible ($S$), infected ($I$) and removed ($R$), the latter meaning either recovered (and immune), hospitalized, self quarantined, deceased or any other situation where the contagion chain develops no further. Its basic implementation assumes no vital dynamics (closed population, no births or deaths in the $S$ compartment) and homogeneous mixing (completely random interactions). Under this assumptions the transitions between compartments are regulated by a set of deterministic differential equations following the mass-action law. \\
  \begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{SIR_02.png}
  	\caption{The complete development of the SIR model starting with $0.1\%$ infected population.}
  	\label{fig:SIRtot}
  \end{figure}


  Calling $N$ the total population, the relative population fractions of the 3 compartments are:
  \begin{align}
			s = \frac{S}{N}  \quad;  \qquad 	 i = \frac{I}{N}  \quad;  \qquad 	 r = \frac{R}{N}
  \end{align}

  The fundamental differential equations of the SIR model read:
  \begin{align}
  	\diff{s}{t} = - \beta s i \quad;  \qquad 	\diff{i}{t} = \beta s i - \mu i \quad; \qquad  \diff{r}{t} = \mu i
  	\label{eq:sir}
  \end{align}

  The total population $N$ is conserved (it's a closed system with no births nor deaths):  
  \begin{align}
  	s + i + r = 1 \quad ; \qquad \diff{s}{t} + \diff{i}{t} + \diff{r}{t} = 0  \quad ; \qquad  \diff{N}{t}= 0
  	\label{eq:sir_sum}
  \end{align}

  The coefficients $\beta$ and $\mu$ are the transition rates of two Poisson processes, i.e. with independent, exponentially distributed events. The ratio between them is called the basic reproduction number $R_0$, which is the expected total number of secondary infections generated by one infected individual (here estimated \textit{a priori}) \citep{R0}.   
  The average time during which an individual can spread the contagion is $\tau_{r} = \sfrac{1}{\mu}$. The infection rate $\beta$ could be seen as the probability of a contagion event in a single time interval. Thus $R_0$ is the product between the probability of one infected individual to infect one susceptible and the total duration of the contagious state.
  \begin{align}
			R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\mu} \quad = \quad \beta \cdot \tau_{r}
			\label{eq:R0}
  \end{align}
% TODO REFERENCE to the "Complexity of R0"  

  \subsubsection{The initial growth}
  The condition for an epidemic to develop is that, given an initial small fraction of infected individuals, their number increases in time, i.e. the time derivative of $i$ is greater than zero:
  \begin{align}
  	\diff{i}{t} = \beta s i - \mu i \quad > \ 0 
  	\label{sir_growthCond}
  \end{align}
  \begin{align} % \qquad \Rightarrow \quad 	
  	\frac{\beta }{\mu} \cdot s \quad > 1  % \mathrm{This \ requires:}
  	\label{eq:sir_growthReq}
  \end{align}
  
  Thus, for a completely susceptible population ($s \approx 1$), the contagion is going to spread if $R_0$ is greater than one. In the initial phase, $s(t=0)$ could be approximated to the constant $s_0$.
  Under this assumption the evolution of the infected population $i(t)$ becomes purely exponential:
  \begin{align}
  	\diff*{i}{t}{t=0} \approx \quad (\beta s_0 - \mu) \cdot i 
  	\label{eq:sir_approxi}
  \end{align}
  \begin{align} % \qquad \Rightarrow \quad 	
  	i(t) \ \approx \ i(0) \cdot e^{K_0 t} 
  	\label{eq:sir_growthK0}
  \end{align}
  \begin{align} % \qquad  \mathrm{with} \qquad 
  	K_0 = (\beta s_0 - \mu)
  	\label{eq:sir_K0}
  \end{align}
	
	$K_0$ is the initial growth rate. The exponential growth could also be described in terms of the doubling time (which is the constant time interval after which the population has doubled):
	\begin{align}
		T_{d} = \frac{\ln 2}{K_0}
		\label{eq:doubling} 
	\end{align}
	\begin{align}
		i(t) \ \approx \ i(0) \cdot 2^{\sfrac{t}{T_{d}}}
		\label{eq:sir_growthTd} 
	\end{align}

	Or it could rather be described with the basic reproduction number $R_0$ itself:
	\begin{align}
		i(t) \ \approx \ i(0) \cdot R_0^{\sfrac{t}{\tau_s}}
		\label{eq:sir_growthR0}
	\end{align}

	The serial interval $\tau_s$ represents the average time elapsed during one complete iteration of the infection chain process (i.e. from a generation $A$ to the generation $B$ of secondary infections produced by $A$) and it is here estimated from $R_0$ and $K_0$, since no real clinical data was analysed: 
	\begin{align}
		\tau_s = \frac{\ln(R_0)}{K_0}
		\label{eq:serial}
	\end{align}

	I will consider the basic reproduction number and the serial interval as general parameters of the specific infectious phenomenon and I will not change them through the epidemic. Real-life, pandemic-scale events are clearly more heterogeneous and those parameters should be estimated from statistical analyses on real cases data.  

  \subsubsection{The evolution of the epidemic}
  As the epidemic grows, the depletion of susceptible individuals is no longer negligible and the reduction of the number of available candidates slows the contagion down.
  The effective reproduction number $R(t)$ follows the evolution of the susceptible population fraction $s(t)$ and represents the remaining strength of the contagion:
  \begin{align}
		R(t) = R_0 \cdot s(t) 
		\label{eq:Rt}
  \end{align}

  When the value of $R(t)$ reaches $1$, the number of simultaneously infected individuals $i(t)$ is at its peak. From there on, it becomes exponentially smaller as the force of the infection lowers with both $i$ and $s$ and eventually dies out: the epidemic has ended.
  
  The instantaneous growth rate $K(t)$ follows the curve of the positive population:
  \begin{align}
  	K(t) =  \diff{\ln(i(t))}{t}
  	\label{eq:Kt}
  \end{align}

	Knowing the instantaneous growth rate and having defined a constant serial interval $\tau_s$ from the initial phase, it is possible to obtain a direct estimate of the daily value of $R(t)$ combining Eq. \ref{eq:sir_growthK0} and Eq. \ref{eq:sir_growthR0}. This estimate will be independent from Eq. \ref{eq:Rt} and will follow the actual evolution of the spreading:

  \begin{align}
  	R_K(t) = e^{K(t) \cdot \tau_s}
  	\label{eq:RKt}
  \end{align}

	But, since they virtually measure the same quantity, $R(t)$ and $R_K(t)$ should be comparable. If they are not, the assumptions on which $R_0$ is based are called into question.
  % TODO aggiungere qualcosa?
  
  \subsection{The SEIR epidemic model}
  The SEIR model adds the exposed (E) compartment to the picture. Compartment E includes individuals who have already been infected but are not yet contagious. The presence of the incubation phase makes this model more suitable for modelling the spread of an influenza-like disease like COVID-19. 
  
  Calling $e = \sfrac{E}{N}$ the new compartment's relative population, the differential equations of the model now read:
  
  \begin{align}
  	\diff{s}{t} = - \beta s i \quad;  \qquad 	\diff{e}{t} = \beta s i - \gamma e \quad; \qquad \diff{i}{t} = \gamma e - \mu i \quad; \qquad \diff{r}{t} = \mu i
  	\label{eq:seir}
  \end{align}

  where $\gamma$ is the poissonian transition rate between the exposed and the infective compartments. The total population is again conserved: $ s + e + i + r = 1$.
  
  While the SIR model was governed by one single differential equation fot $i(t)$ (Eq. \ref{eq:sir_approxi}), the SEIR one needs a system of two equations for $e(t)$ and $i$.
  The system can be written in the form of a matrix operator applied to a vector. Determining the temporal evolution of the model is here an eigenvalue problem. Specifically, the initial growth problem with the $s(0) = s_0$ approximation reads as follows: 
  
  \begin{align}
  	\diff{}{t}
  	\begin{pmatrix}
  			e \\
  			i
  	\end{pmatrix}_{t=0}
  	\approx \
  	\begin{pmatrix}
  		 - \gamma & \beta s_0\\
  		 \gamma & - \mu
  	\end{pmatrix}
  	\begin{pmatrix}
  		e \\
  		i
  	\end{pmatrix}
	  \quad = \quad K_0 %^{SEIR}
	  \begin{pmatrix}
	  	e \\
	  	i
	  \end{pmatrix} %> 0
		\label{eq:seir_approxi}
	\end{align}

The initial growth coefficient $K_0$ for the SEIR model is the bigger eigenvalue of the operator and it is obtained solving the equation: 

	\begin{align}
		\det 
		\begin{pmatrix}
			- \gamma - K_0 & \beta s_0\\ % ^{SEIR}
			\gamma & - \mu - K_0  %^{SEIR}
		\end{pmatrix} = 0
	\label{eq:seir_K0}
	\end{align}
 
 The initial evolution of the total positive population $p(t)$ still follows an exponential law identical to Eq. \ref{eq:sir_growthK0}.
%  given by: % $p(t) = e(t) + i(t)$ 
 \begin{align}
		p(t) = \ e(t) + i(t) \quad \approx \  p(0) \cdot e^{K_0 t}
 \end{align}

%  But due to the incubation delay that is added to the dynamics of the infection, the other parameters being equal, the initial growth will be slower than in the SIR model.
 
	\section{Numerical models}
	\label{sec:numerical}
	
  \subsection{Model configuration}
	The SIR and SEIR model are initialized with the same input parameters (obviously except $\gamma$). Among the initial population of 10 000 people, there are initially 10 infected and already contagious individuals ($i(0) = 0.1 \%$).
	
	Epidemiological studies have identified that, for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the incubation period is approximately 4 to 5 days ($https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMcp2009249$), specifically 4.2 d according to $https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article$. The same study shows that, before awareness of the COVID-19 danger, the time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 5.5 days, whereas after reports of potential human-to-human transmission, the duration shortened significantly to 1.5 days. We can assume similar time scales for the self-quarantine measures. Since patients may be infectious 1 to 3 days before symptom onset ($https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMcp2009249$), the actual model parameters should be shifted of that interval, being the model not about symptoms but infections. 
	
  The model is therefore initialized with three days removal period (population in "awareness mode") and three days incubation period. 
  The respective transition rates are both equal to $0.33 d^{-1}$ as shown in Tab. \ref{tab:params}. 
  The "non-awareness mode" with a removal period of seven days is treated without numerical simulations in Section \ref{sec:immuni}, just to highlight the importance of the early hospitalization of patients. 
  
  
  \input{params.tex}
 
  
  The $\beta$ parameter is equal to $0.73 d^{-1}$ and has been chosen to produce a basic reproduction number $R_0$ near 2.2, which is in good agreement with the referenced literature for respiratory diseases transmitted over breath droplets like influenza, common cold, COVID-19 or SARS \citep{bibid}.
  
  The expected values of $R_0$, $K_0$ and $T_d$ are calculated directly with Eq. \ref{eq:R0}, Eq. \ref{eq:seir_K0} and Eq. \ref{eq:doubling} respectively and are presented in Tab. \ref{tab:props}. The SEIR initial doubling time is longer than the SIR one because of the delay added by the incubation phase, but both are very short. Given the reproduction number of $2.19$, the serial interval $\tau_s$ for the SEIR model results $4.9 \ d$ from Eq. \ref{eq:serial}, i.e. smaller than the total average duration of the illness $\tau_{r}$.
  \input{props.tex}  
  
  \subsection{Numerical solutions}
	The time-continuous evolutions of both deterministic models are calculated integrating the differential equations with an ODE solver of the \textit{SciPy} python library (see Section \ref{sec:code}). 
	The complete evolution of the SIR model is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:SIRtot}. It displays all the features discussed analytically in Section \ref{sec:theory}. After a fast initial growth, the number of individuals which simultaneously have the disease reaches a peak of $1900$ ($18.8 \%$ of the total population) on day 18. After $60 \ d$ the total outbreak size $r_{final}$ has reached $85 \%$ and the infected population $i_{final}$ is zero.
	
	The SEIR model instead reaches the peak only on day 41 and the epidemic remains active until day 100. Nevertheless, the peak size and the total outbreak size remain the same. The incubation time has no effect on the magnitude of the epidemic, only on the time scales (at least at this analytical level). These informations are summarized in Tab. \ref{tab:models}. 
	\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{SIR_03.png}
		\includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{SEIR_03.png}
		\caption{Exponential growth in the initial phase of an outbreak for SIR (\textbf{left}) and SEIR (\textbf{right}). }
		\label{fig:BothExp}
	\end{figure}

	\input{models.tex}

	The values of the initial growth rates $K_0^{Fit}$ and doubling times $T_d^{Fit}$ are also indicated there. These are not the ones from Tab. \ref{tab:props} predicted analytically, but are estimated through an exponential fit of the positives curve $i(t)$ limited to the initial phase of the epidemic, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:BothExp}. 
	The initial part is arbitrarily selected to terminate at $0.16$ of the curve's maximum (epidemic peak) or to include at least 5 readings (from day 0 to day 4). 
	$K_0^{Fit}$ results $0.38 \ d^{-1}$ for the SIR model and  $0.15 \ d^{-1}$ for the SEIR one, in good agreement with the expected values. I will always plot both exponential fits over the positives curve when analysing the initial phase of an outbreak (the predicted in red, the extrapolated in black). 
	
	The complete evolution of the relative populations of the four compartments of the SEIR model is pictured in Fig. \ref{fig:SEIRboth}, left panel. The delay between the exposed peak and the infected peak is clearly visible. Since the two transition rates $\gamma$ and $\mu$ are equal, the two curves are identical and just shifted in time (otherwise the smaller the rate out, the bigger the relative population). %the compartment with the smaller out-rate would grow more than the other). 
	\begin{figure}[h!]

		\caption{\textbf{Left}: Typical evolution of a SEIR model. \textbf{Right}: Instantaneous reproduction number }
		\label{fig:SEIRboth}
	\end{figure}
	 
  %To gauge the strength of the epidemic process, the reproduction number is followed through the evolution of the contagion. 
	In the right panel, the same evolution is described by means of the instantaneous reproduction number. The blue line represents the estimate obtained from Eq. \ref{eq:Rt}; the orange line shows instead the result of Eq. \ref{eq:RKt}.
	To calculate the value of $K(t)$ from Eq. \ref{eq:Kt}, the derivative is performed with second order accurate central differences. The $R = 1$ red dashed line is plotted for reference.
	
  The initialization of the SEIR model with $i(0) = 0.001$ means that no incubation delay is present, so the numerical estimate of $R(t)$ overshoots the expected value at the beginning. After that the two estimates are in perfect agreement: the decaying slope is the same and so is the day when $R = 1$ is reached. Later on some discrepancy arises, $R_K(t)$ halting at $0.5$.\\
  %%%% QUI  \\

	% TODO check the numbers
	%	$\gamma = 0.05 \ d^{-1}$ The growth is slower due to the delay added by the incubation period $\tau_{i}=\sfrac{1}{\gamma}$. The serial interval associated to the basic reproduction number is therefore bigger: $25 d$ instead of just $7 d$. Here $r_{final}$ and the peak intensity are practically the same as in the SIR model ($84 \% \ \mathrm{vs} \ 85 \%$ and $18.75 \% \ \mathrm{vs} \ 18.79 \% \ $ respectively), but the peak is reached 137 days later (on day 195), the end of the SEIR epidemic 337 days after the SIR has ended (on day 525). 
	%This is the reference framework to which the following simulations are compared.

  \section{Complex networks}
  \label{sec:network}
  Homogeneous mixing hypothesis is certainly inadequate for real systems modelling. Human social networks %and physical contact maps 
  show structural heterogeneity spanning various scales. Here I will adopt the simplest network representation of the social contacts, i.e. with the nodes representing the individuals and the edges (links) the %existing patterns of
  interactions between them. All edges are considered equally effective in transmitting the contagion (un-weighted network). The model will be discrete both regarding time, at the $1 d$ scale, and the number of cases, at the single individual scale. Edges will be bi-directional (un-directed network) because there is no hierarchical or ordering process in influenza-like diseases spreading, apart from a node being already infected or not (but this is the model responsibility, not the network). Edges and nodes are static in time, meaning that contacts are supposed to be all active for all the time at the daily scale and that neither births nor deaths are considered, the same as was for the deterministic models. %Some detailed studies reach down to the 5 minutes level and weigh contacts with actual physical distance \cite{Firth2020}.
  
  The transition rates $\beta$ are the product between the probabilities of the contagion happening during a single interaction $\beta_k$ and the average number of interactions per node, which is the average connectivity degree $\langle k \rangle$ of the networks.
  
	%  of each node and is fixed for the whole period (static network). 
  
	The average connectivity degree $\langle k \rangle$ is set equal to 12 for all network types and assumed as a reasonable approximation for the average daily physical contacts of one individual in real life. 
	
%	More advanced approaches like the ref ($https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1036-8\#Sec12$), with network topology following the actual contact dynamics during the day are not reproduced here due to computational and complexity concerns (difficulties, limitations?). confirm the assumptions on daily averages
	
	%No characterization of the strength of the interactions is attempted (the networks are un-weighted) and all contacts are assumed mutual (networks are un-directed). 
  To maintain the same configuration of the deterministic numerical models, the probability $\beta_k$ is fixed to $6.1 \%$, so that:
  \begin{align}
			\beta_k \cdot \langle k \rangle = 0.73 = \beta
  \end{align}
  
  Approach: recreate the same analysis work flow of the deterministic model
%The simulation time step is $1 \ d$.
  
  The deterministic prediction works as mean field approximation?
%  
%  Here $\beta$ is the contagion probability for a single interaction ($\xi$) times the average number of interactions which is given by the average connectivity degree $<k>$ of the network. The $<k>$ and $\xi$ parameters are chosen in such a way that $\beta$, hence $R_0$, is kept constant and equal to the deterministic infection rate. This is done to allow cross-network intercomparison. Given that the average connectivity is considered, for heterogeneous networks there could locally be major fluctuations from the average behaviour.
%  
  
%  Initial 10 infected nodes chosen at random (further work: ensemble)
  simulations are run in batches of 100 per network type.
  
  \subsection{Network models}
  Erdos Renyi
  Contagion on random network evolves similarly to the deterministic ODE problem. 
  
  Smoothing of the positives (Exposed + Infected) curve is needed to avoid contamination from numerical and most importantly network noise. 
  
  Network noise is strictly linked to the random nature of the network, locally there are deviations from the average connectivity which make the epidemic evolve ad different speeds
  
  
  
  \input{networks.tex}
  
  \subsection{Lattice}
  Ring
  The contagion is strongly inhibited, starts exponentially slower than the rest, Rt(0) most similar to predicted R0,
  then stops (no, oscillates around R=1, still going) with plenty of susceptible nodes still available but not reachable. Try with more days.
  
  
  \subsection{Small-World}
  Watts Strogatz
  NOT TRUE: Starts similar to lattice, evolves similar to random. GOOD
  
  \subsection{Scale free}
  Barabasi-Albert
  Initial boost is the fastest, $K_0=0.006$ and Td is less than 12 days. Look at the degree structure..
  
  
  \subsection{Scale free with clustering}

  The initial growth is almost exponential and $K_0$ is high but after that the pandemic slows down extremely fast
