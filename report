Evolution of a pandemic in a small world network

Watts stroglatz small world networks (rewired lattices with p probability)
Params: p (probability of rewiring lattice edges into random links) 
        k (level of clustering in terms of lattice connected neighbours)  
        n (dimension of the network)

Presentation of the typical characteristics of the small world graphs: recreate the plot with C (clustering) and L (min path distance) for a pool of differen graphs in function of p (test also k)

One peculiarity: fast spreading of diseases (contagion), iportance of the rewired edges in sensibly lowering the distance between clusters

Similarity with real cases:  high p and high k --> worst case?
                             high p and low k  --> globalized but non village-like society or restrictions to aggregation
                             low p and high k  --> international lockdown, return to small communities
                             low p and low k   --> full lockdown
                             low p and low k + synthomatic nodes are disconnected --> lockdown + quarantine

Epidemic model:

SEIR over a network, with R(DOTS) parameters
    
    (D) duration of the infection (around a week)
    (O) opportunities during the infection (social behaviour) ~ 5 people per day

    (T) transmission probability
    (S) susceptibility of the target

    R = D x O x T x S

    Isolation of the infected (quarantine) --> D
    Social distancing --> 0
    Masks and other PPE (DPI) --> T
    Vaccine? Good health/immune system --> S

    Reproduction number can (does) change over time
    

Test of the evolution of the similar-to-real cases

Framework: networkx and CoLab (pyTorch?)
